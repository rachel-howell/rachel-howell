## Hi, I'm Rachel!

### I'm a meticulous and driven software developer with expertise in MERN-based web application development. 

🔎 I'm eagerly seeking out new opportunities to contribute to challenging projects that will push me out of my comfort zone.  
👩🏽‍💻 I'm a natural leader with a knack for delegating tasks fairly and efficiently.  
🙌🏼 In addition to the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, Javascript), I am familiar with Java, Python, C++, Swift, and C#. I do not fear new tech stacks. I embrace the challenge and enjoy the struggle.  
🪲 I squash bugs like a hot knife cuts through butter.  
🏋🏼 When I'm not writing code, you can find me lifting weights, wandering through the forests of Portland, and chilling with my cats.  
🤔 What are you waiting for? Check out my portfolio and let's build!
