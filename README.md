## Hi, I'm Rachel!

### I'm a self-driven and detail-oriented software development engineer in test. I also like doing software development as a hobby.

👩🏽‍💻 My favorite languages are Python and Typescript. I have extensive experience writing UI-based tests with Playwright and API testing scripts in various languages. I have a knack for identifying and automating tedious processes.
🤖 I love working with AI. I'm using Ollama to make my own custom LLM right now.
🏋🏼 When I'm not breaking software or writing code, you can find me lifting weights, doing arts and crafts, and hanging out with my cats.
