## Hi, I'm Rachel!

### I'm a meticulous, self-driven software QA engineer and software developer.  

👩🏽‍💻 My favorite technologies are React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I am able to learn new languages and frameworks easily.  
🔎 I'm eagerly seeking out new opportunities to contribute to challenging projects that will help me grow as a software developer.  
🏋🏼 When I'm not writing code, you can find me enjoying live music, lifting weights, and hanging out with my cats.  

## My Projects:

### RSWatchWorks
> Fully functional e-commerce website for custom watch company.

### ~ The Ballot Box ~
> a labor of love built in collaboration with my incredible dev team.

This virtual polling app did more than help maintain the integrity of virtual elections: it helped me learn GitHub collaboration etiquette with an actual team of developers. I learned that the only thing better than building web applications... is building web applications *together*. 🫂
