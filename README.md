## Hi, I'm Rachel!

### I'm an ambitious, detail-oriented full stack software engineer with expertise in React / Node.js / Express / MongoDB web application development. 

🔎 I'm eagerly seeking out new opportunities to contribute to challenging projects that will push me out of my comfort zone.  
👩🏽‍💻 I'm a natural leader with a knack for delegating tasks fairly and efficiently.  
🙌🏼 In addition to the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, Javascript), I am familiar with Java, Python, C++, Swift, and C#. I do not fear new tech stacks. I embrace the challenge and enjoy the struggle.  
🏋🏼 When I'm not writing code, you can find me lifting weights, wandering through the forests of Portland, and chilling with my cats.  

## My Projects:

### ~ shaker a.k.a. Shakerr.io ~
> my debut; my pride and joy; my very first full-stack web application.  
 
This application took me on a deep dive through the hairy jungle of RESTful API calls and database querying. Check it out to view, edit, create and delete your very own cocktail recipes!

### ~ The Ballot Box ~
> a labor of love built in collaboration with my incredible dev team.  

This virtual polling app did more than help maintain the integrity of virtual elections: it helped me learn GitHub collaboration etiquette with an actual team of developers. I learned that the only thing better than building web applications... is building web applications *together*. 🫂
