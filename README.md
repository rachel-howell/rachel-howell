## Hi, I'm Rachel!

### I'm an ambitious, detail-oriented full stack software engineer with expertise in React / Node.js / Express / MongoDB web application development. 

👩🏽‍💻 My favorite technologies are Next.js, GraphQL, and Shopify. In addition to the fundamentals (HTML, CSS, Javascript), I am familiar with Java, Python, C++, Swift, and C#. I love learning new techologies. I embrace the challenge and enjoy the struggle.  
🔎 I'm eagerly seeking out new opportunities to contribute to challenging projects that will push me out of my comfort zone.  
🙌🏼  I'm a natural leader with a knack for delegating tasks fairly and efficiently.  
🏋🏼 When I'm not writing code, you can find me lifting weights, wandering through the forests of Portland, and chilling with my cats.  

## My Projects:

### ~ The Ballot Box ~
> a labor of love built in collaboration with my incredible dev team.

This virtual polling app did more than help maintain the integrity of virtual elections: it helped me learn GitHub collaboration etiquette with an actual team of developers. I learned that the only thing better than building web applications... is building web applications *together*. 🫂
